            <h1>The Yips</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h2>
              Professional athletes are highly trained and skilled individuals
              who have become the best at their given sports. Sometimes,
              however, even the performance of professionals declines because of
              their mindsets. The yips is a common psychological phenomenon
              where an athlete loses the fine motor skills needed to perform in
              his or her sport. A one-time master will suddenly lose the ability
              to carry out a task he or she once knew so well. Some experts
              believe the yips is due to the continual use of the same muscles
              in order to perform a particular movement in a sport, which
              eventually leads to an increase in the deterioration of muscle
              tissue and nerve damage. Other experts suggest that the yips is
              strictly a psychological problem, and the player should be treated
              through psychoanalysis, meditation, or other cognitive means.

            <h2>
              Brains are an integral part of the decision-making process for all
              living organisms. However, social insects like ants, bees, wasps,
              and termites are capable of solving complex problems as a unit.
              These insects do not work individually, but as a collective in
              order to create a kind of "super brain," which is usually referred
              to as swarm intelligence. Swarm Intelligence is a phenomenon where
              hundreds, or even thousands of organisms work together for the
              benefit of the group. Combining their efforts, many minds work
              together as one, making collective decisions as a whole. Like the
              neurons connected and working together in a single brain, hundreds
              of individual brains are connected into one organized system of
              thought.

            <h2>
              When travelling or living abroad, people encounter some situations
              that they may find surprising, even shocking. This phenomenon is
              known as culture shock. It is a state of discomfort provoked by
              cultural differences that could include but are not limited to
              mindset, behavior, practices, and style of communication. Cultural
              practices and traditions are sometimes difficult for travelers to
              comprehend because they are starkly different from his or her own
              upbringing. Conversely, expatriates, living for extended periods
              of time abroad, may begin to adopt the practices of the culture
              they reside in and identify with it more than the society in which
              he or she was born and raised. Upon returning home, these
              individuals may actually experience reverse culture shock.

            <h2>
              Compassionate consumerism is a relatively new trend in the
              American retail market. In this type of consumerism, when
              individuals make a purchase a portion of the money they pay is
              allocated to a charitable cause. Nowadays, individuals often look
              for ways to contribute to the betterment of humanity, but they
              don’t always have the financial resources to do so. Compassionate
              consumerism appears to be a good middle ground. While critics feel
              that it’s only a marketing ploy aimed at appealing to people in
              their 20s and 30s, others applaud the effort. They argue that it
              is desirable for companies to sacrifice profits in order to help
              those in need.

              Pictographs are very simple pictures that represent a word or
              idea. This artwork is the earliest known form of writing, with
              archaeological discoveries of pictographs dating back to 3000 BC
              in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Scholars believe that pictographs
              developed independently in many different parts of the world,
              including the Middle East, China, and Mesoamerica. Because early
              pictographs were meant to resemble physical objects, they tended
              to represent nouns that referred to concrete things, but as
              pictographs in the ancient world became visually simpler and more
              abstract, they stopped representing actual objects. Instead, they
              began to represent abstract concepts and phonetic sounds. In time,
              pictographs became the basis for modern writing systems.
