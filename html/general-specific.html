              on campus and in the city at large. Instead, all students will now
              be given a fifty-dollar pass for public transportation. It will be
              renewable each semester. This pass can be used on all public
              subways and buses. While the university regrets this
              inconvenience, it is hoped that students will take the opportunity
              to immerse themselves more closely in the local community.

              currently coaches the women’s softball team, will also fill the
              role of coach of the women’s volleyball team next semester. As the
              softball coach for the last three years, Coach Jepsen has led the
              team to an excellent winning record and two championships. In
              addition to her success on the field, Coach Jepsen has proven
              herself to be an excellent leader who always makes time to offer
              students personal guidance and academic support. During her time
              in charge, the average GPA for student-athletes on the softball
              team rose substantially. The college feels sure Coach Jepsen will
              excel in her new role.

              The graduation committee would like to formally announce that we
              have decided to conduct two separate graduation ceremonies
              starting this year. As many of you already know, enrollment
              numbers have increased dramatically over the past five years.
              Since each student must be given their diploma individually, the
              ceremony now lasts too long. Moreover, there is not enough space
              in the auditorium to accommodate all the family members of each
              graduating class. We believe this new arrangement will ensure that
              future graduation ceremonies are organized, intimate, and brief.

              Beginning next semester, students will no longer be able to buy
              paper books. Instead, students will be required to download all of
              their books to an electronic book reader. After hearing from
              students involved in the Environmental Protection Club, we believe
              it is socially irresponsible to continue to force students to buy
              books that require the use of natural resources, like the trees
              needed to produce the paper used in textbooks. We have also
              received countless complaints about the price of books from
              students. Switching to an e-book format will be a more affordable
              option that will reduce the cost of buying textbooks by up to 50%.

              We have recently had a large number of students who are unable to

              Therefore, students will now be required to create their schedule
              with an academic advisor before the next semester begins and will
              not be allowed to register for a class without their approval.
              Professors currently complain that many students who are enrolled
              in advanced level classes have not first taken the required lower
              level classes. Moreover, speaking with an advisor will help
              students choose classes more suited to achieving their long-term
              career goals.
