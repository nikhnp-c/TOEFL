              The test-taker must read the question posted by the professor and
              the two student responses. Finally, they should write their own
              response which addresses the question and adds to the
              conversation. They have ten minutes to complete the task.

              Today we’re going to talk about the debate between economic growth
              and protecting the environment. Economic growth creates new jobs
              and gives people money they can use to improve their lives. On the
              other hand, if we protect the environment it can be enjoyed both
              by ourselves and future generations. If you had to choose between
              prioritizing economic growth or protecting the environment, which
              one would you choose. Why?

              I would prioritize the environment. We only have one planet and if
              we don’t take care of it, we won’t have pleasant lives in the
              future. Economic growth can be important, but not at the expense
              of the environment. I think we need to shift towards more things
              such as investing in renewable energy and promoting
              environmentally-friendly technologies. We’ll all live much
              healthier lives if the world around us is clean.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Maggie:</h2>
            <h3>
              While I agree with Alex that environmental sustainability is
              important, I think that economic growth is the only way to solve
              many of the social and economic problems we face. We need a strong
              economy to create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve standards of
              living. Not only that, but when companies grow stronger and more
              profitable, they can develop new technologies that solve our
              environmental problems.

                  This is a challenging topic, but I think we should prioritize
                  the environment at this time. I strongly agree with Alex’s
                  idea that our lives will be unpleasant if we focus entirely on
                  economic growth. I would add that if the environment is
                  damaged by industrial development we’ll all be more likely to
                  suffer from serious ailments like cancer and lung disease.
                  These sorts of illnesses can be a real strain on our medical
                  systems. Maggie raised the relevant point that it’s possible
                  that profitable companies will someday solve all of our
                  problems using new technology, but she doesn’t mention that
                  they might arrive far too late to be of use. For example, it
                  could take decades for an innovative company to create a
                  source of clean energy.

                While I appreciate the points mentioned by both Maggie and Alex,
                I think that we should mainly focus on economic growth. This is
                because our lives will become unpleasant if the economy slows
                down. We all have bills to pay and those require us to earn an
                income. Remember that many people have families to take care of,
                so they need to earn a regular income. That is only possible if
                the economy continues to grow at the same rate year after year.
                Some people may feel that preserving the environment is more
                important than maintaining our current standard of living, but I
                tend to disagree. My main focus is on the quality of life that
                people enjoy at this exact moment, not the lives that future
                generations will lead.
