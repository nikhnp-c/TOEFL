              Today we’re going to talk about the debate between economic growth
              and protecting the environment. Economic growth creates new jobs
              and gives people money they can use to improve their lives. On the
              other hand, if we protect the environment it can be enjoyed both
              by ourselves and future generations. If you had to choose between
              prioritizing economic growth or protecting the environment, which
              one would you choose. Why?
            </h3>

            <h2>Alex:</h2>
            <h3>
              I would prioritize the environment. We only have one planet and if
              we don’t take care of it, we won’t have pleasant lives in the
              future. Economic growth can be important, but not at the expense
              of the environment. I think we need to shift towards more things
              such as investing in renewable energy and promoting
              environmentally-friendly technologies. We’ll all live much
              healthier lives if the world around us is clean.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Maggie:</h2>
            <h3>
              While I agree with Alex that environmental sustainability is
              important, I think that economic growth is the only way to solve
              many of the social and economic problems we face. We need a strong
              economy to create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve standards of
              living. Not only that, but when companies grow stronger and more
              profitable, they can develop new technologies that solve our
              environmental problems.

                  This is a challenging topic, but I think we should prioritize
                  the environment at this time. I strongly agree with Alex’s
                  idea that our lives will be unpleasant if we focus entirely on
                  economic growth. I would add that if the environment is
                  damaged by industrial development we’ll all be more likely to
                  suffer from serious ailments like cancer and lung disease.
                  These sorts of illnesses can be a real strain on our medical
                  systems. Maggie raised the relevant point that it’s possible
                  that profitable companies will someday solve all of our
                  problems using new technology, but she doesn’t mention that
                  they might arrive far too late to be of use. For example, it
                  could take decades for an innovative company to create a
                  source of clean energy.

                While I appreciate the points mentioned by both Maggie and Alex,
                I think that we should mainly focus on economic growth. This is
                because our lives will become unpleasant if the economy slows
                down. We all have bills to pay and those require us to earn an
                income. Remember that many people have families to take care of,
                so they need to earn a regular income. That is only possible if
                the economy continues to grow at the same rate year after year.
                Some people may feel that preserving the environment is more
                important than maintaining our current standard of living, but I
                tend to disagree. My main focus is on the quality of life that
                people enjoy at this exact moment, not the lives that future
                generations will lead.

              Today, we’re discussing the ethics of targeted advertising. Some
              people argue that online advertising which uses personal
              information to target specific people is an invasion of privacy.
              Others argue that it’s simply an acceptable way to reach consumers
              with products and services they’re interested in. What’s your
              take? Do you think targeted advertising is ethical, or is it an
              invasion of privacy?
            </h3>

            <h2>Jessica:</h2>
            <h3>
              I think targeted advertising is an invasion of privacy.
              Advertisers shouldn’t be able to track and use our personal
              information to sell us products. It’s not fair to consumers, and
              it’s a violation of our rights. Instead, advertisers should focus
              on creating high-quality ads that appeal to a broad audience. By
              doing that they can both increase their sales and show respect for
              their customers.

            <h2>Mike:</h2>
            <h3>
              I disagree with Jessica. To me, targeted advertising is ethical.
              It’s a more efficient way to reach consumers with products and
              services that are relevant to their interests. With the money they
              save by using more effective marketing techniques, companies can
              afford to offer lower prices to their customers. Plus, we can
              always opt-out of targeted advertising by adjusting our privacy
              settings. As long as we get a choice, I think targeted advertising
              can be beneficial.

                  This is a controversial topic, but I think that targeted
                  advertising isn’t an ethical problem and I’m not concerned
                  about it. I really like Mike’s idea that we can just opt-out
                  of targeted advertising if we are worried about it. I’d add
                  that it is extremely easy to do this nowadays, as Internet
                  browsers are very user-friendly. Even people that are
                  inexperienced with technology can find the right settings and
                  adjust them. Jessica raised the relevant point that companies
                  should create advertisements that appeal to a broad audience,
                  but she didn’t mention how difficult it is to make
                  advertisements like that. Society is more diverse than ever
                  before, so it is almost impossible to create messages that
                  everyone finds attractive. Small companies without large
                  advertising and research budgets might go out of business if
                  they are prevented from using cheap and effective targeted
                  advertising.

                While I think Mike raised some relevant points, I really feel
                that targeted advertising is problematic. Nowadays families are
                struggling to make ends meet, and they don’t have money for
                frivolous luxuries. Unfortunately, people are easily influenced
                by what they see online, and personalized ads might cause them
                to buy stuff they don’t need… and can’t afford. This is
                especially true when it comes to young people. A lot of my
                classmates can barely afford to pay for their tuition and books,
                but they still buy expensive gadgets that are promoted on social
                media. Consequently, I think the government ought to come in and
                regulate this part of the advertising industry.

              Today, we’re going to discuss the impact of social media on
              society. On one hand, social media platforms like Facebook,
              Twitter, and Instagram have connected people from all over the
              world. However, there are concerns about the negative effects of
              social media, such as the spread of misinformation, the rise of
              cyberbullying, and addiction to social media use. What do you
              think? Does social media cause more harm than good?
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Sarah:</h2>
            <h3>
              I think that social media has caused more harm than good. While
              it’s true that social media platforms have connected people in
              unprecedented ways, they have also caused real harm to individuals
              and societies. Additionally, when people spend too much time on
              social media platforms, they could suffer from mental health
              problems such as anxiety and depression. This is probably because
              they allow people to anonymously bully and harass other users.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Mark:</h2>
            <h3>
              I think that social media has mostly improved society. For
              instance, it has given a voice to people that previously were
              ignored. Moreover, it has provided platforms for political
              activism that has led to positive change. And, of course, social
              media has made it easy for everyone to stay connected to family
              and friends who are far away. In the past we had to make expensive
              phone calls to contact our loved ones, now we can talk to them and
              send them pictures for free on social networks.

                  While I totally understand what both of you mean, I mostly
                  agree with Mark’s idea that social media is beneficial. I
                  really like how social media sites help people to hear the
                  opinions from a diverse range of people. Traditional media
                  outlets are controlled by the rich and powerful nowadays, so
                  they don’t often include the voices of common people. On the
                  other hand, everyone can use social media as a platform to
                  share their ideas. For instance, last week I read a Facebook
                  post about an effort to unionize a coffee shop in Washington.
                  That’s not the sort of thing we can hear about on CNN or in
                  the New York Times.

                that society used to ignore. I’d add that it is almost
                impossible for most people to get their messages on television
                or in print media because those are controlled by companies and
                wealthy individuals. Sarah raised the relevant point that social
                media causes mental health problems in some young people, but
                she didn’t mention that social media can also help us to cope
                with and recover from such problems. For example, there are a
                lot of support groups on communities like Facebook where people
                can talk about their struggles and get advice from people going
                through similar experiences. Many people have mentioned that
                such groups are critically important to their lives.

              In class today, we’re going to talk about grading students. Before
              you come to class, I want you to think about whether grades are
              beneficial. On one hand, they provide a way to measure students’
              progress. On the other hand, some argue that grades are too
              focused on performance and don’t provide an accurate picture of a
              student’s overall academic abilities. If you had to choose, would
              you say that students should be given grades or not? Why?
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Lila:</h2>
            <h3>
              I think that students should not be given grades. Grades create a
              needlessly competitive environment and can make students feel like
              they are only valued for their academic performance. When students
              feel that grades are the most important thing, they get
              discouraged. Instead of giving specific grades, teachers should
              provide personal feedback that helps students understand what they
              need to improve and how they can do so. I think that approach
              leads to more academic success.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Jake:</h2>
            <h3>
              I believe that grades are the only way for students to understand
              how well they are doing and the only way to motivate them to work
              harder. Without grades, there would be no way to measure their
              progress or to identify areas where they need to improve.
              Moreover, grades prepare students for the real world where they
              will be judged based on their performance. The only way for adults
              to advance in their careers is to consistently perform well, and
              grading children prepares them for that.

                  children should be given grades on a regular basis. Even young
                  kids want to improve academically, and grades help them to do
                  so. Remember that students are aware that they must develop
                  strong academic skills if they want to achieve their goals in
                  life. Grades indicate the current level of their skills and
                  tell them whether or not they should change how they approach
                  their studies. For instance, a student who has received a
                  fantastic grade in math and a poor grade in science will know
                  to spend more of his free time studying science. In contrast,
                  a student who hasn’t gotten any grades will have no idea what

                can lead to a focus on test-taking strategies rather than actual
                learning, and as a result students may not fully engage with the
                material. This means they could lack key knowledge that they’ll
                need when they move on to the next stage of their academic life.
                Jake raised the relevant point that grades are the only way to
                identify the specific areas where students are weak, but he
                didn’t mention that teachers can study samples of their
                students’ work to find their weaknesses without actually grading
                the work. For example, they could look at a student’s essay, see
                that he is weak when it comes to grammar, and tell him that in
                person.

              I support the idea of taxing unhealthy products. These products
              are often high in sugar, salt, and fat, which can lead to serious
              health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. As
              you said, by taxing these products, the government can discourage
              people from consuming them and resolve some of these health
              issues. Moreover, the revenue generated can be used to fund
              advertising campaigns that promote healthy eating habits.
            </h3>

            <h2>Tanya:</h2>
            <h3>
              I believe that such taxes are unfair to families that don’t have a
              lot of money. Wealthy people will not care about the taxes and
              their habits won’t change. Additionally, when prices go up, people
              usually try to save money by purchasing lower-quality products
              that are cheaper to begin with. If people start buying low-quality
              food they could suffer even more health problems. There are better
              solutions to this problem than taxes.

                  While both Sam and Tanya raised some relevant points, I share
                  Tanya’s opinion that the government probably shouldn’t tax
                  unhealthy products. Remember that our health depends on a lot
                  of factors, so focusing entirely on our diets is
                  counterproductive. The food we eat certainly impacts our
                  health, but so does the amount of exercise we get. Even if we
                  eat junk food all the time, we can avoid burdening the health
                  care system by exercising on a regular basis. Therefore, I
                  don’t think it is fair to punish people just for what they
                  eat. Instead, the government should focus on educating people
                  about healthy habits in general.

                In my opinion, it’s probably a good idea to tax some unhealthy
                products. I strongly agree with Sam’s idea that taxes on junk
                food can reduce the prevalence of serious health problems in
                society. The government already spends an enormous amount of
                money treating people with such illnesses, but can’t afford to
                do that forever. I read that the budget of our national health
                care system has increased by 20% in the last five years, which I
                found shocking. Tanya mentioned that people might turn to
                lower-quality products to save money, but she didn’t mention
                that the government can prevent this by using the money from the
                tax to make healthy choices more affordable. For example, they
                could subsidize products like fresh fruit and vegetables.

              A new story about Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the news
              almost every day. And, of course, companies are spending an
              enormous amount of money to develop new technologies related to
              AI. Before next class, I want you to consider the following
              question: Is AI a dangerous technology that, overall, will be
              harmful to society, or is it a powerful tool that will improve the
              lives of people?
            </h3>

            <h2>Meghan:</h2>
            <h3>
              Personally, I think AI is a threat. As AI advances, many jobs may
              become automated, leaving people without work. That will certainly
              increase income inequality. Additionally, there’s the risk that AI
              systems could be programmed with biases or used to discriminate
              against certain groups. We need to be careful and ensure that AI
              is developed in an ethical and responsible way. Since we can’t
              guarantee that right now, I think it is best to slow down.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>David:</h2>
            <h3>
              I disagree with Megan. I’m of the opinion that AI has the
              potential to solve many of the world’s problems, from climate
              change to disease. Additionally, AI can help us make better
              decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying
              patterns that humans may miss. That said, I agree with Megan that
              we must ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible way
              that benefits society as a whole.

                  While I can understand both points of view, I think that AI is
                  mostly helpful and will improve our lives over time. Like
                  David, I’m really confident that AI will help us deal with
                  many serious problems currently affecting society. It has
                  already been used to make driving safer and reduce car
                  accidents, so we currently have some proof that AI is helping
                  people around the world. According to statistics I read last
                  week, self-driving cars get in accidents 80% less frequently
                  than cars driven by humans. That seems like an incredible
                  advantage to me. Remember that new technologies are always
                  scary at first, but we shouldn’t let our fears prevent us from
                  making progress.

                No one can predict the future with absolute certainty, but I am
                pretty sure that AI will cause a lot of problems in the long
                run. For instance, think about the effect it will have on
                education. We’ve already heard that many university students are
                using artificial intelligence to cheat on their assignments. It
                is almost impossible for teachers to detect when an essay has
                been written by an AI bot, so lazy students have stopped writing
                their papers altogether. Not only are students using AI to write
                their essays, but some are even using it to do math assignments…
                or even write computer code for their computer science classes.
                While I’m sure that no one in THIS class is dishonest, we cannot
                ignore the overall trend.

                  In my opinion, new scientific discoveries are the main reason
                  we live longer nowadays. New technology also makes it a lot
                  easier for doctors to deliver those treatments. In many cases,
                  doctors can assist patients over the Internet, even from miles
                  away. That wasn’t possible when my parents were young. Back
                  then, the average life expectancy was much lower than it is
                  now. It’s certainly true that public campaigns about healthy
                  eating and exercise have improved our lives, but people
                  actually have less healthy diets and get less exercise than
                  they did in the past. Despite that, they still live longer
                  lives. For example, although children are less likely to have
                  physical education classes or play outside nowadays, they
                  still suffer from fewer diseases than in the past.

                A lot of things impact how long we live, but I’m fairly sure
                that our longevity is mainly due to improved government
                services. In the past, it was normal for people to go decades
                without getting a regular checkup, but nowadays local
                authorities encourage people to get checked out by a doctor on
                an annual basis. While individuals are certainly more likely to
                be diagnosed with life-threatening diseases nowadays, early
                detection means that they are also more likely to be cured. I
                think health care services like this will continue to be
                well-funded in the future, so our life spans might get even
                longer.

              Funding for education is a really hot topic nowadays, so today
              we’re going to talk about how universities use their limited
              resources. In the discussion board please respond to the following
              question: Should universities prioritize funding academic
              facilities like libraries, or is it okay to spend just as much
              money on sports and athletic programs?

            <h2>Rachal:</h2>
            <h3>
              I think universities should prioritize funding for libraries.
              Libraries are essential for academic research, and they provide
              students with access to information and resources that they might
              not have otherwise. Investing in libraries can also help attract
              and retain the most talented professors, which can ultimately
              benefit the university as a whole. Sports, on the other hand,
              appeal to just a few people.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <h2>Mike:</h2>
            <h3>
              While I agree that libraries are important, I think that sports
              programs should also be a priority for universities. Sports can
              bring the campus community together, even if that just means they
              attend sports and cheer for their favorite athletes. Meanwhile,
              among the athletes themselves, sports promote teamwork and
              leadership skills. Additionally, successful sports programs can
              generate revenue for the university and boost its reputation.

                  In my opinion, universities should spend more money on

                  recruit the best possible students, which improves their whole
                  academic environment. Everyone enjoys classes a lot when their
                  classmates are intelligent and devoted to their studies, so
                  this seems like an obvious choice to make. Mike raised the
                  relevant point that athletic events bring people close
                  together, but he didn’t mention that there are other ways to
                  do that which are much more affordable. For example,
                  organizing a campus festival is a more cost-effective way to
                  help students bond than funding an entire football team.

                While Rachel brought up a few great points, I still believe that
                it is worthwhile to fund athletics. Remember that most
                universities in this country are pretty much the same in terms
                of classes and professors, but a winning sports team can help a
                school stand out from the crowd. Many high school students pick
                their university based on the success of its sports teams, so it
                is probably a smart idea to make sure those teams get enough
                funding. I certainly agree that libraries are ultimately more
                important than football stadiums, but when enrollment goes up
                there will be more money for libraries and other academic
                facilities.

              I think investing in infrastructure should be the main priority
              for every local government. This could include things like
              repairing roads and bridges, expanding public transportation, and
              improving access to clean water and sanitation. When cities have
              good infrastructure it’s easier for residents to get around, and
              new businesses are attracted to the area. They also experience
              fewer serious accidents.

              While I agree that infrastructure is important, I think that
              social programs should also be a major focus. The government could
              invest in things like education, affordable housing, and
              healthcare, which can help address issues like poverty,
              inequality, and access to basic needs. By providing these types of
              services, the government can help improve people’s well-being.
              These are things that everyone benefits from… unlike a road which
              is only used by people who drive cars.

                  access to training and programs that improve their skills they
                  might have more success in the job market. Cities with higher
                  employment rates have happier people and lower crime rates, so
                  I think this approach is a wise one. Although it’s true that
                  governments already spend a lot on education, I think
                  investing even more in this area will help a wide range of
                  citizens.

                Some people in the class might disagree, but I am convinced that
                governments should invest more in maintaining national parks. As
                countries become more urbanized, the need for green spaces
                increases. While people in cities can easily access a great
                number of fantastic amenities like stadiums and cinemas,
                sometimes we need to spend some time surrounded by nature. By
                making national and state parts easier to access, governments
                can help citizens unwind and feel better about their lives.
                Whenever I visit a park I am able to forget about the stress and
                anxiety I get from my classes, but the closest one is almost a
                two hour drive from campus! This might sound superficial
                compared to things like building schools or maintaining bridges,
                but I really think that mental health is a critical issue
                nowadays.

              Next week, we’re going to spend a lot of time in class discussing
              the positive and negative ways in which companies affect the world
              around us. Before we start talking about that in class, I want to
              hear what you think about the topic. So here’s a question for the
              message board: In your opinion, what is the best way for a company
              to have a positive impact on society?

              I believe that companies should focus on making their operations
              more socially and environmentally friendly. While charitable
              giving can be beneficial, it doesn’t address the root causes of
              serious social and environmental problems. By doing business in
              more responsible ways, companies can have a more meaningful and
              lasting impact on society. Moreover, if they attract positive
              attention from consumers they could inspire other companies to do
              the same. That’s the only way we can really solve today’s
              problems.

              While those are very good points, I think that companies should
              focus on charitable giving. Philanthropy can provide immediate
              relief to those in need and contribute to the overall well-being
              of society right away. It could take years or decades for business
              changes to have a positive impact on society, and most people just
              can’t wait that long.

                  This is a challenging topic, but I think donating to charity
                  is the best way for companies to make the world better. I
                  strongly agree with John’s idea that charitable donations are
                  a way to quickly address the serious problems that we are
                  facing. I’d add that some of these problems – like
                  homelessness and food insecurity – are more serious than they
                  have ever been, so companies certainly have a role to play.
                  Even a small donation can save someone’s life. Sarah raised
                  the relevant point that philanthropy might help businesses to
                  attract new customers, but she didn’t mention that nowadays
                  people’s purchasing decisions are mostly based on cost. Many
                  people prefer to buy the cheapest products available, even if
                  they are sold by unethical companies. Because the economy is
                  in such rough shape, they just can’t afford to think about the
                  reputation of a business when they are shopping.

                While I appreciate the points mentioned by both Sarah and John,
                I think that companies should focus on paying their employees
                higher salaries. We all know that nowadays people around the
                world are struggling just to keep their heads above water.
                Everyone is also aware that inflation is out of control, so even
                basic necessities are quite expensive. Remember that children
                from poor households don’t always live up to their potential, so
                business executives ought to help them by paying their parents
                higher wages. Some people may feel that this approach doesn’t
                address long-term concerns like climate change, but I think that
                poverty is accelerating and could be an even bigger concern in
                the future.
