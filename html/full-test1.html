                <div class="teal spacer">One</div>
                The development of the modern presidency in the United States
                began with Andrew Jack son, who swept to power in 1829 at the
                head of the Democratic Party and served until 1837. During his
                administration he immeasurably enlarged the power of the
                presidency. "The president is the direct representative of the
                American people;' he lectured the Senate when it opposed him.
                "He was elected by the people, and is responsible to them:' With
                this declaration, Jackson redefined the character of the
                presidential office and its relationship to the people.
                <div class="teal spacer">Two</div>
                During Jackson's second term, his opponents had gradually come
                together to form the Whig Party. Whigs and Democrats held
                different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the
                market, banks, and commerce. The Democrats tended to view
                society as a continuing conflict between "the people"-farmers,
                planters, and workers-and a set of greedy aristocrats. This
                "paper money aristocracy" of
                <div class="red">bankers and investors</div>
                manipulated the banking system for their own profit, Democrats
                claimed, and sapped the nation's vir tue by encouraging
                speculation and the desire for sudden, unearned wealth. The Demo
                crats wanted the rewards of the market without sacrificing the
                features of a simple agrarian republic. They wanted the wealth
                that the market offered without the competitive, chang ing
                society; the complex dealing; the dominance of urban centers;
                and the loss of indepen dence that came with it.
                <div class="teal spacer">Three</div>
                Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the market.
                For them, com merce and economic development were agents of
                civilization. Nor did the Whigs envision any conflict in society
                between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople
                and bankers on the other. Economic growth would benefit everyone
                by raising national income and expanding opportunity. The
                government's responsibility was to provide a well regulated
                economy that guaranteed opportunity for citizens of ability.
                <div class="teal spacer">Four</div>
                Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward
                the market but also about how active the central government
                should be in people's lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's
                inclination to be a strong president, Democrats as a rule
                believed in limited gov ernment. Government's role in the
                economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies 1
                and special privileges. In keeping with this philosophy of
                limited government, Democrats also rejected the idea that moral
                beliefs were the proper sphere of government action. Religion
                and politics, they believed, should be kept clearly separate,
                and they gener ally opposed humanitarian legislation.
                <div class="teal spacer">Five</div>

                The Whigs, in contrast, viewed government power positively. They
                believed that it should be used to protect individual rights and
                public liberty, and that it had a special role where individual
                effort was ineffective. By regulating the economy and
                competition, the government could ensure equal opportunity.
                Indeed, for Whigs the concept of government promoting the
                general welfare went beyond the economy. In particular, Whigs in
                the north ern sections of the United States also believed that
                government power should be used to foster the moral welfare of
                the country. They were much more likely to favor social-reform
                legislation and aid to education.
                <div class="teal spacer">Six</div>
                In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was similar.
                To be competitive in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had
                to have significant support among farmers, the largest group in
                society, and workers. Neither party could win an election by
                appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor. The Whigs,
                however, enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business
                and commercial classes. Whigs appealed to planters who needed
                credit to finance their cotton and rice trade in the world
                market, to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses, and
                to workers who wished to improve themselves. Demo crats
                attracted farmers isolated from the market or uncomfortable with
                it, workers alien ated from the emerging industrial system, and
                rising entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies and open the
                economy to newcomers like themselves. The Whigs were stron gest
                in the towns, cities, and those rural areas that were fully
                integrated into the market economy, whereas Democrats dominated
                areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and
                languishing economically.

              <h1>BIRD SONGS AND CALLS</h1>
            </div>

                <div class="teal spacer">One</div>
                Birds use song both in courtship and to define areas of
                territory. Both of these are com municative purposes: the bird
                is passing specific messages to other members of its species.
                Birds communicate for other reasons as well: a blackbird, for
                instance, will make a sharp "p ink-pink" sound when there is a
                cat nearby, which warns other birds in the neighborhood of the
                danger.
                <div class="teal spacer">Two</div>
                William Thorpe (1961) studied the behavior of gannets in a
                colony containing many thousands of birds. Thorpe found that
                when a bird was returning to its nest, it would drift on an
                updraft of air from the bottom of the cliff upwards, calling as
                it went. When the bird on the nest heard its mate calling, it
                would call in reply, showing that each bird's call could act as
                an identification signal. Thorpe also discovered that a bird
                might have as many as f ifteen or sixteen different kinds of
                calls, each serving a different function.
                <div class="teal spacer">Three</div>
                J. R. Krebs (1976) realized that birds often sing more
                intensively in the early morning the "d awn chorus:' By
                investigating what the birds actually did during each day, and
                how much time they spent on each activity, Krebs found that the
                dawn chorus serves a largely territorial function. The early
                morning is not a particularly good time for gathering food, be
                cause it is dark, so visibility is lower, and it is also cold,
                so many insects are still inactive. On the other hand, at this
                time many birds move around looking for living space, so
                establish ing and defending a territory is necessary. Birdsong
                is not just territorial, of course. A bird's song can serve a
                dual purpose: it can be used to defend a territory and, by
                indicating to a prospective mate that the singer has a territory
                to defend, can also attract a female bird.
                <div class="teal spacer">Four</div>
                P. J. B. Slater (1981) suggested that bird calls and birdsong
                are partly learned from other birds. He found that chaffinches
                which had been hand-reared and had not heard other wild birds
                made an entirely different kind of "c hink" call from that of
                wild birds. In another case, Slater observed a laboratory
                chaffinch in a duet with a wild sparrow outside the window of
                the laboratory. The chaffinch imitated the sparrow's "c heep"
                whenever the sparrow pro duced it. Slater concluded that
                learning through copying is an important part of the way in
                which birds acquire their songs. Slater also found that
                individual chaffinches can have up to f ive different types of
                song. Some of these are personal, sung by that bird alone.
                Others are shared by several birds. In some cases too, Slater
                observed chaffinches singing songs which were almost identical
                to those sung by others, but with just a note or two
                different-pos sibly because the bird had made an error in
                copying the song from another.
                <div class="teal spacer">Five</div>

                Slater studied a population of 40 chaffinches on the Orkney
                Islands and found that among them they had seventeen different
                song types. So it was not a matter of each bird having its own
                individual songs-there was a considerable amount of sharing.
                Slater found that this sharing related to geographical
                distribution, but that the boundaries were not distinct enough
                for it to be accurately described as a dialect, or regional
                variety of a song. Instead, there was considerable overlap
                between the songs sung in one area and those sung in an
                adjoining one, but gradually the overlap would become less,
                until birds a long distance away from one another would be
                singing entirely different songs.
                <div class="teal spacer">Six</div>
                In 1970, Peter Marler proposed that birdsong and human speech
                were directly compa rable in certain key respects, and that the
                study of birdsong might provide psychologists with some useful
                indicators as to the nature and development of speech in human
                beings. One of the parallels which Marler identified was the way
                that both humans and birds show a strong genetic predisposition
                to pick up and imitate certain sounds rather than others. Marler
                showed that young birds will learn the songs of their own
                species if they are played to them when young, but they will
                ignore songs of birds from other species. Similarly, young human
                beings are surrounded by all kinds of sounds and noises, but it
                is the human voice to which they listen most closely and human
                speech which they imitate.
