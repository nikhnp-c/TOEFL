              The situation at the health center is unacceptable: you sit in a
              crowded waiting room for hours waiting to get treatment for minor
              ailments. Then when it’s your turn, you get about three minutes
              with an overworked doctor. I have two suggestions: first, the
              health center needs to hire more doctors so that each patient
              receives quality treatment. And as far as the wait time issue is
              concerned, the health center is currently open only Monday through
              Fridays, which means that people who get sick over the weekend
              wait until the following week to get treatment. So, opening the
              health center on weekends should solve that problem too.

            <h2>
              When people work in groups to perform a task, individual group
              members may feel less motivated to contribute, since no one person
              is held directly responsible for completing the task. The result
              is that people may not work as hard, or accomplish as much, as
              they would if they were working alone and their individual output
              were being measured. This decrease in personal effort, especially
              on a simple group task, is known as social loafing. While it is
              not a deliberate behavior, the consequence of social loafing is
              less personal efficiency when working in groups than when working
              on one’s own.
