          <div class="content">
            <h2>
              The campus fitness center will permanently close at the end of
              this semester. This decision was made by the university
              administration in coordination with representatives of the
              student’s association. Unfortunately, the building currently
              housing the center is very old and the university can no longer
              afford the cost of maintaining it or providing heat and air
              conditioning as required. Furthermore, the popularity of the
              center has declined since the university formed partnerships with
              several private fitness centers in the city. These partnerships
              mean that all full and part time students can access five
              privately owned gyms across the city at no cost.

          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h2>
              The geology department is aware of the problems surrounding of
              group work, and its unpopularity among students. We realize that
              in some cases students do not contribute and thus gain marks they
              do not deserve, while stronger students are frustrated at being
              held back by weaker students. Similarly, it is very difficult for
              tutors to award marks for group projects, as it is unclear who is
              responsible for each part. However, the department feels that
              there is a great deal to be gained from group work, in terms of
              self-organization and communication skills. To this end, we plan
              to introduce a system whereby the group work itself is not
              formally assessed, but each student will undertake an individual
              piece of work based on the group project, which will be designed
              to ensure participation in the project.

            <h2>
              The Chemistry Department is planning to award scholarships to
              students who have received an average grade of 90% or above. We
              have found there to be a serious need for well-educated chemistry
              students and the current pool of chemists is highly lacking. By
              awarding these scholarships, it will allow future chemists to get
              a better handle on their tuition costs as well as encourage
              students to study harder in class. After the recent audit, we have
              found there to be plenty of funds for this department and we feel
              this is the best place to use them. Considering this school spends
              most of its funds on the Sports Department, we want to get
              students more interested in chemistry and we feel this is the best
              place to start.

          <div class="content">
            <h2>
              How does an Ivy League educational institute, such as U of C get
              away with being so nonchalant about recycling? After a recent
              search across campus, volunteers from the U of C Environmental
              Watch group counted only 10 recycling bins. In comparison, the
              students counted 30 vending machines, the majority of which carry
              plastics, cans, and glass bottles. Only one paper recycling bin
              was found. This means that almost all of the paper that is
              discarded on campus, including U of C residences, is being
              disposed of in the regular garbage. When asked why no recycling
              bins for paper have been placed on campus, U of C president, James
              Wicker, explained that the company the university employs to pick
              up recycling does not currently recycle paper. When asked why
              another company is not used, Wicker cited university finances as
              an obstacle.
