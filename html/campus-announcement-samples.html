            <h2>
              The campus fitness center will permanently close at the end of
              this semester. This decision was made by the university
              administration in coordination with representatives of the
              student’s association. Unfortunately, the building currently
              housing the center is very old and the university can no longer
              afford the cost of maintaining it or providing heat and air
              conditioning as required. Furthermore, the popularity of the
              center has declined since the university formed partnerships with
              several private fitness centers in the city. These partnerships
              mean that all full and part time students can access five
              privately owned gyms across the city at no cost.
