            <h3>
                I agree with the idea of giving children homework on a daily basis.  I feel this way for two reasons.
                <br />
                First of all, I think that it will help children to retain what they learn for a much longer period of time.  The only real way for kids to absorb a lesson is to actually go home and repeat it as much as they possibly can.  And in the long run this kind of thing will lead to a lot more academic success.
                <br />
                Secondly, I believe that homework can actually give children an opportunity to bond with their parents.  For example, I got a lot of daily homework when I was in elementary school. And I’d go home and do it with my mom and dad, and I’d ask them questions whenever I was having trouble. And in time we actually became really close.

            <h1>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should help their parents with household chores as soon as they are old enough. Use details and examples in your response.</h1>
            <h3>I think it’s a great idea for kids to do household chores as soon as they’re old enough.  <br />
                First of all, this can teach children some really valuable skills that will come in handy later in life.  For instance, I was responsible for cooking breakfast for my little brother every day before we went to school when we were both kids.  As a result, when I went away to college as a teenager I stayed really healthy because I could cook my own meals instead of always going out for fast food like my friends and classmates.<br />
                Secondly, parents and children can do household chores together and this gives them a chance to bond.  You know, as they work on things like cleaning dishes or cooking food they can chat, and the kids might open up about what’s going on in their lives.

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  It is better for children to have teachers who are young, even if they are inexperienced.</h1>
            <h3>I think it’s better for students to have young teachers even if they’re a little bit inexperienced. <br />
                First of all, young teachers can relate more to their students.  They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it’s easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day.<br />
                Secondly, younger teachers have a lot more energy.  Class sizes are huge now.  In fact, they’re probably bigger than ever before.  This can create trouble for older teachers who might run out of energy and not be able to finish their lessons if they have a huge group of students.

            <h1>Do you agree or disagree with the following sentence?  We can learn a lot from making mistakes.</h1>
            <h3>I totally agree that we can learn a lot from making mistakes.<br />
                First of all, we always remember how our past mistakes made us feel and since they usually make us feel really terrible, we try to avoid repeating them, so we don’t feel that way again.  We also take deliberate action to avoid it.  For instance, last year before my big science midterm I made the mistake of playing video games all day long.  As a result, of course I failed the test and I felt miserable. But, I learned from that that it’s very important to study and prepare for tests.  So, the next year during exam season I buckled down, I studied, and I learned a lot.
