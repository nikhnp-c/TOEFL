                    <h2>I agree with the idea of giving children homework on a daily basis.  I feel this way for two reasons.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, I think that it will help children to retain what they learn for a much longer period of time.  The only real way for kids to absorb a lesson is to actually go home and repeat it as much as they possibly can.  And in the long run this kind of thing will lead to a lot more academic success.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, I believe that homework can actually give children an opportunity to bond with their parents.  For example, I got a lot of daily homework when I was in elementary school. And I’d go home and do it with my mom and dad, and I’d ask them questions whenever I was having trouble. And in time we actually became really close.

                    <h2>I think it’s a great idea for kids to do household chores as soon as they’re old enough.  <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, this can teach children some really valuable skills that will come in handy later in life.  For instance, I was responsible for cooking breakfast for my little brother every day before we went to school when we were both kids.  As a result, when I went away to college as a teenager I stayed really healthy because I could cook my own meals instead of always going out for fast food like my friends and classmates.<div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, parents and children can do household chores together and this gives them a chance to bond.  You know, as they work on things like cleaning dishes or cooking food they can chat, and the kids might open up about what’s going on in their lives.

                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, young teachers can relate more to their students.  They simply have a lot more in common with them in terms of personal interests and pop culture awareness.  As a result, it’s easier for them to connect the classroom material to the real lives of the students.  This can encourage kids to stay motivated and keep on task for their whole school day.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, younger teachers have a lot more energy.  Class sizes are huge now.  In fact, they’re probably bigger than ever before.  This can create trouble for older teachers who might run out of energy and not be able to finish their lessons if they have a huge group of students.

                    <h2>I totally agree that we can learn a lot from making mistakes.<div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, we always remember how our past mistakes made us feel and since they usually make us feel really terrible, we try to avoid repeating them, so we don’t feel that way again.  We also take deliberate action to avoid it.  For instance, last year before my big science midterm I made the mistake of playing video games all day long.  As a result, of course I failed the test and I felt miserable. But, I learned from that that it’s very important to study and prepare for tests.  So, the next year during exam season I buckled down, I studied, and I learned a lot.

                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, I can focus entirely on what I need to learn.  When we study in a group everyone has different weak spots, and they all deserve to be touched on, even if some members of the group are really strong in those areas.  In contrast, when we work alone we can focus entirely on our own weak spots and therefore get the best possible test score.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, I’m easily distracted which can have disastrous effects when I study in a group.  For instance, last year I was preparing for a midterm exam with a bunch of classmates but we ended up chatting a lot about music and sports instead of studying.  And, therefore, my test score was quite bad.

                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, too much time spent watching the nightly news makes me feel really anxious.  For instance, if I hear about some new war or disaster every day of the week I get really depressed and this make it a lot harder to function in my daily life.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, I think watching the news every day can be a waste of time. Like, if I spend an hour every day watching a news broadcast I just don’t have enough time for more important things. For example, this month I stopped watching the nightly news and suddenly it became a lot easier to get all of my homework assignments done.

                    <h1>Some teachers encourage their students to work alone on projects and compete with each other. Other teachers encourage them to collaborate and work in groups. Which approach do you think is better?</h1>

                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, this teaches students skills that are useful in the workforce.  For example, in my senior year I had a history class where I worked on a major assignment with five different students.  While working on the assignment, I had to handle scheduling and I even had to deal with interpersonal-conflict between different members of the group.  Both of these things taught me skills that I use almost every day in my career now.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, group projects simply have better outcomes.  Group projects benefit from the expertise of many different people.  As a result, the final project is usually of a higher quality than a student would complete on their own.

                    <h1>Some companies have rules that forbid employees from using personal cell phones during working hours. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</h1>

                    <h2>I think it’s a really terrible idea to tell employees that they can’t use their phones during working hours. 
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, our personal phones are the only way for us to hear about emergencies affecting our loved ones.  And this is something we want to hear about as soon as humanly possible.  You know, if a worker feels nervous about being out of touch with his loved ones during the day, he might actually start looking around for a job that lets him use his phone and this would be really bad for business.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, I think personal phones can maybe improve our morale at work.  We can relieve our stress by making a quick phone call or looking at a social media post.  And if we feel happier we’ll probably performer a lot better.

                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        First of all, it can make us feel a lot more self-confident.  If we really like our appearance we can feel a lot less shy when talking to people.  And it will be easier to interact and therefore we’ll achieve more success in our personal and professional lives.
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, if we don’t like the result of our surgery we can always change it back.  I mean, plastic surgery is really affordable these days, so if you get some surgery and it looks bad… you can just get another procedure done.  For instance, I’ve changed my nose about six times already, and the expense to me has been pretty minimal.

                        Firstly, you can take the courses wherever you are, as long as you have a computer and internet access. 
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Secondly, discussions in the classes could be easier for some students who are very shy to engage with friends, classmates, and professors face to face. They can talk about whatever they like when facing a computer. 
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        Additionally, it could be much easier for students to hand in their assignments. They could simply send an email to the professor, who can then provide feedback on the assignments via email.
