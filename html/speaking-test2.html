              the tuition and fees have remained the same, but it is necessary

            <h2>
              For thousands of years, humans have been able to domesticate, or
              tame, many large mammals that in the wild live together in herds.
              Once tamed, these mammals are used for agricultural work and
              transportation. Yet some herd mammals are not easily domesticated.
              A good indicator of an animal's suitability for domestication is
              how protective the animal is of its territory. Nonterritorial
              animals are more easily domesticated than territorial animals
              because they can live close together with animals from other
              herds. A second indicator is that animals with a hierarchical
              social structure, in which herd members follow a leader, are easy
              to domesticate, since a human can function as the "leader"
