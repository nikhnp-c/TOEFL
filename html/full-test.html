                <div class="teal spacer">One</div>
                The development of the modern presidency in the United States
                began with Andrew Jack son, who swept to power in 1829 at the
                head of the Democratic Party and served until 1837. During his
                administration he immeasurably enlarged the power of the
                presidency. "The president is the direct representative of the
                American people;' he lectured the Senate when it opposed him.
                "He was elected by the people, and is responsible to them:' With
                this declaration, Jackson redefined the character of the
                presidential office and its relationship to the people.
                <div class="teal spacer">Two</div>
                During Jackson's second term, his opponents had gradually come
                together to form the Whig Party. Whigs and Democrats held
                different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the
                market, banks, and commerce. The Democrats tended to view
                society as a continuing conflict between "the people"-farmers,
                planters, and workers-and a set of greedy aristocrats. This
                "paper money aristocracy" of bankers and investors manipulated
                the banking system for their own profit, Democrats claimed, and
                sapped the nation's vir tue by encouraging speculation and the
                desire for sudden, unearned wealth. The Demo crats wanted the
                rewards of the market without sacrificing the features of a
                simple agrarian republic. They wanted the wealth that the market
                offered without the competitive, chang ing society; the complex
                dealing; the dominance of urban centers; and the loss of indepen
                dence that came with it.
                <div class="teal spacer">Three</div>
                Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the market.
                For them, com merce and economic development were agents of
                civilization. Nor did the Whigs envision any conflict in society
                between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople
                and bankers on the other. Economic growth would benefit everyone
                by raising national income and expanding opportunity. The
                government's responsibility was to provide a well regulated
                economy that guaranteed opportunity for citizens of ability.
                <div class="teal spacer">Four</div>
                Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward
                the market but also about how active the central government
                should be in people's lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's
                inclination to be a strong president, Democrats as a rule
                believed in limited gov ernment. Government's role in the
                economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies 1
                and special privileges. In keeping with this philosophy of
                limited government, Democrats also rejected the idea that moral
                beliefs were the proper sphere of government action. Religion
                and politics, they believed, should be kept clearly separate,
                and they gener ally opposed humanitarian legislation.
                <div class="teal spacer">Five</div>

                The Whigs, in contrast, viewed government power positively. They
                believed that it should be used to protect individual rights and
                public liberty, and that it had a special role where individual
                effort was ineffective. By regulating the economy and
                competition, the government could ensure equal opportunity.
                Indeed, for Whigs the concept of government promoting the
                general welfare went beyond the economy. In particular, Whigs in
                the north ern sections of the United States also believed that
                government power should be used to foster the moral welfare of
                the country. They were much more likely to favor social-reform
                legislation and aid to education.
                <div class="teal spacer">Six</div>
                In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was similar.
                To be competitive in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had
                to have significant support among farmers, the largest group in
                society, and workers. Neither party could win an election by
                appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor. The Whigs,
                however, enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business
                and commercial classes. Whigs appealed to planters who needed
                credit to finance their cotton and rice trade in the world
                market, to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses, and
                to workers who wished to improve themselves. Demo crats
                attracted farmers isolated from the market or uncomfortable with
                it, workers alien ated from the emerging industrial system, and
                rising entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies and open the
                economy to newcomers like themselves. The Whigs were stron gest
                in the towns, cities, and those rural areas that were fully
                integrated into the market economy, whereas Democrats dominated
                areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and
                languishing economically.
